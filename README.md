## âœ… Automated Pull Request Checks

This repository uses GitHub Actions to enforce code hygiene and PR size tracking.

### ðŸ”¹ PR Size Labels
PRs are automatically labeled based on the number of added/changed lines:

| Label | Lines of Code |
|-------|----------------|
| XS    | 0â€“9            |
| S     | 10â€“49          |
| M     | 50â€“199         |
| L     | 200â€“499        |
| XL    | 500+           |

### ðŸ”¹ Merge Commit Check
To avoid polluting the Git history, PRs are scanned for **merge commits**. If found, the workflow will fail.

âœ… **Use this instead of merging**:
- `git pull --rebase`
- `git rebase main` before pushing

### ðŸ”¹ Git Fetch Depth
The `checkout` step uses `fetch-depth: 0` to fetch the full commit history.  
This is required for merge commit checks to work properly.
